# IRTF Proposed Research Group: Sustainability and the Internet Research Group (SUSTAIN RG)

		Draft Charter Proposal v1.0 (31 October 2024)

## Vision

The long-term goal of the Sustainability and the Internet Research Group (SUSTAIN RG) is to contribute to the advancement of the Internet as 
a fundamental part of sustainable and resilient societies and planets, through conceptual and 
evidence-based research collaboration.

## Scope

The SUSTAIN RG will identify and explore research challenges in developing and operating a sustainable Internet, from a networking 
perspective. It will provide a venue for discussion, collaboration and development of longer-
term Internet research on sustainability and its trustworthy dissemination. Grounded in the 
practical operation of the Internet, the RG will work to bring greater understanding of 
architectural and policy implications relating to environmental, social and economic 
sustainability challenges of internetworking, without going into advocacy actions. 

Recognizing their interconnectedness, the SUSTAIN RG will focus on the Sustainability of 
the Internet (footprint), while fostering an appreciation of the Internet for Sustainability 
(handprint). The SUSTAIN RG adopts a multidisciplinary, systems perspective, considering 
the interdependencies between different types of networks as well as different research 
disciplines. 

## Background

The Internet is a global critical infrastructure, on which societies, individuals and businesses 
depend. It is expected to play a positive role in tackling global challenges such as climate 
change, decarbonization, and environmental degradation. Yet at the same time, there is 
growing concern about the negative impacts. Internet technologies are part of value chains 
that are driving increased energy, materials and natural resource use, and increasing carbon 
emissions. It is imperative to minimize these negative impacts, to support global 
sustainability goals, as per the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 

There are numerous research challenges for a sustainable Internet and its applications. 
Characterization, monitoring, management and mitigation of the Internet environmental 
footprint, as well as the timely collection, distribution and sharing of accurate measurement 
data and assessments are open challenges. Additionally, there are considerable hurdles in 
linking the Internet to sustainability outcomes in real-life use cases in a causal way, due to 
the absence of practical methodologies and examples to do so. SUSTAIN RG will 
systematically work to frame these challenges for the benefit of the Internet community - 
architects, developers, operators, users, and policy makers alike. 

## Research areas

SUSTAIN RG will invite contributions on topics relating to the long-term sustainability of the 
Internet:

- Reduction of the Internet footprint (environmental, social, economic), working with 
quantitative and qualitative indicators, their baselines and targets, measurements and 
assessments, sharing related data, conceptual and policy frameworks, considering 
lifecycle as well as supply chain issues, including circularity and materials use. 

	o Investigate environmental limits and boundaries within which the Internet and 
	its applications should operate safely and the corresponding policy 
	implications. 

	o Investigate the relationship between sustainability and the Internet 
	architecture (e.g., distributed, centralized, edge computing, cloud, virtualized, 
	overlaid, including caching and in-network computation, as well as the impact 
	of service delivery methods) to understand the implications and environmental 
	impact of differing approaches to network design and the trade-offs.

	o Investigate novel approaches not only to energy efficiency, energy savings 
	and energy proportionality, but also to overall greenhouse gas emissions 
	reductions, like increasing the role of renewables in powering Internet 
	infrastructure, carbon-aware routing, traffic steering, data transmission, and 
	synergistic balancing of supply and demand of renewables and computing. 

- Understanding the role of policy and regulation in the environmental, social and 
economic sustainability of the Internet, as complementary to technological and 
operational factors, for example to incentivize sustainability.

- Understanding the impacts of different strategies for managing the potential rebound 
effects (Jevon's paradox) of Internet sustainability gains, including technical, policy 
and regulatory aspects.

- Understanding new methodologies, architectures and strategies to ensure Internet 
resilience in the face of sustainability challenges, considering resource impacts, 
carbon efficiency and operational complexity.

## Mode of operation

The SUSTAIN RG will solicit academic, governmental and industrial research contributions to 
enhance the state of the art and our understanding of the relationship between the Internet 
network infrastructure and applications and sustainability from long-term conceptual, systems 
and policy perspectives.

The SUSTAIN RG will hold regular meetings, encouraging hybrid modes of attendance to 
reduce the environmental impact of travel, and will organize interim meetings as needed that 
might align with sustainable networking conferences, workshops and other events. It will 
coordinate with other IRTF RGs, like GAIA, HRPC and DINRG, with IETF WGs like GREEN, 
TVR, OPSWG, as well as with the Internet Society, and the sustainability efforts of other 
SDOs, industrial consortia, and research organizations. Since the IAB E-impact program is 
the venue for Internet architecture and environmental sustainability-related guidance and 
coordination among various IETF & IRTF groups, SUSTAIN RG will inform the E-impact 
program about its research activities and collect corresponding feedback from it. 

The group will organize awareness-raising activities, such as invited talks from sustainability 
experts, including from systems, environmental, social and economic sciences and 
practitioners that work on sustainability target setting, policy, assessments and strategy, to 
clarify the linkages. It will work to create a focused topic area during the ACM/IRTF Applied 
Networking Research Workshop (ANRW) on sustainability and invite contributions, to 
develop a broader publication stream for research in this space.

The group may publish RFCs to transfer research results and feedback to the IETF 
community but defers to the IETF for technology standardization. The aim of the RFC series 
output would be to take stock of state-of-the-art research results, making recommendations 
on standardization gaps, policy concerns, and strategy opportunities with the broader 
Internet community.
