# IRTF_SUSTAIN_RG
Working space for developing the draft charter of the proposed IRTF Sustainability and the Internet Research Group (SUSTAIN RG).

At IETF 121 in Dublin, Ali Rezaki, Eve Schooler and Michael Welzl held a Public Side Meeting on Wednesday, 6 November 2024 at 14:30 - 15:30  GMT, to present the draft charter for the proposed IRTF Sustainability and the Internet Research Group (SUSTAIN RG). The draft charter document is available in this repository in pdf and md formats. It was also shared in the E-impact, green-wg and IRTF-discuss mailing lists with many comments received via e-mail as well. 
The date, time, room as well as on-line WebEx access link for the IETF 121 side meeting were provided in the agenda file in this repository. You can access the agenda and the presentation slides at:

Please provide any updates to the notes if you have attended the meeting and also kindly include your name in the attendee list. The recording of the session will also be shared in this repository once it is made available to us by the IETF Secretariat.  
We are aware that the side meeting is difficult to attend remotely, although we had good particiption as the provided infrastructure at IETF 121 worked quite well. Accordingly, we have reached out to the community to arrange an additional on-line meeting about a week after the IETF 121 to ensure participation from remote participants as well. However, there were only three responses with tentative interest. Accordingly, we decided not to hold an additional on-line meeting to review the charter again.  
We will share the updated draft charter here and will look forward to your comments via GitHub or e-mail.  
Thanks very much for your interest and contribution.
